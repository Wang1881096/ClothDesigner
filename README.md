# ClothDesigner

This is a project during my PHD period, for clothes simulation and template manipulation. The UI design is learned from MarvelousDesigner (https://www.marvelousdesigner.com/). The core simulation algorithm is a simplified GPU implementation of ARCSIM (http://graphics.berkeley.edu/resources/ARCSim/).
